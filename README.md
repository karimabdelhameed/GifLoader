# GifLoader
The main purpose of this repo is load and control Gif images in android natively. 


# Description : 
Due to some limitation on my project, I had to load GIFs into ImageViews wihtout relay on any 3rd-party libraries like Glide,Picasso, ...etc . 
So, I've searched a lot and it ends up with this implementation to load GIFs natively.

# Note : 
I also used the old way for calling the network with <code>URLConnection</code> instead of any network library, due to same purpose/limitations.
